SpringBoot and .Net Web API are fast, but I think Node/Express is just as fast.  In this repo, I put together a "simulated" Customer Resource Management CRUD api endpoints.  I'm using mongodb as my database, I'm using POSTMAN to test the endpoints, and I'm using OpenSSL to test Node's https security protocol, more to come.
